#### Some of the past public projects

 - [2020] Dockerized code of [eBayKleinanzeigen](https://github.com/denisergashbaev/ebayKleinanzeigen/pull/1/files) for automating ads
 - [2018] Together with [desmonduz](desmonduz) and [progre55](https://github.com/progre55) created a rather successfull (at the time, ~30-50 users a day) Telegram bot -- [PreviewBot](https://github.com/denisergashbaev/PreviewBot2) -- that reduced the size of the forwarded videos to save internet traffic for the users where mobile internet was expensive.
